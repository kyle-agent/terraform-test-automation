# Coverage-expansion session handoff

**Branch:** `main` — consolidated 2026-06-08 (PR #14); all prior `claude/*` scratch
branches in this repo were deleted. Resume from `main`.
**Last updated:** 2026-06-08
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for resuming the Terraform-provider coverage
expansion work in a fresh session. **Start at [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md)** (mission +
multi-agent architecture + session bootstrap), then this file, then
`coverage/registry.yaml`.

## 0Y. Session 2026-06-12 (LATEST) — domain-knowledge-driven fixes, green 56→57+, #83 cracked for eventstreams

**Branch:** `claude/wonderful-keller-h05ucp` (all 3 repos; provider branch == fork main b5b7197).
**Method:** multi-agent — inspection (registry/non-green triage), domain research (api-test-automation
`data/api_docs.json` = scraped FULL API request schemas + `validated-facts`), provider audit (fix presence
+ open issues), plus implementation agents (peering probe, dbaas probe extension).

### Sweep run 27399112864 results (no leaks; all teardowns clean)
- **eventstreams_basic → GREEN** (#83 CRACKED): the bare 400 value_error was THREE fixture defects found
  via the scraped API schema: (1) cluster `name` pattern is `^[a-zA-Z]*$` — the old default `regr-evs`
  hyphen was rejected; (2) `akhq_enabled=true` without akhq creds/node group is an invalid topology → off;
  (3) v1.1 create requires `service_watch_log_collection`. Full lifecycle green.
- sqlserver_cluster: `license=""` (was a retail key) got PAST the parse error → now named 400
  **"Invalid Engine Version"** (data-source first-non-EOS id rejected) → dbaas_probe `sqlserver-versions`
  mode iterates all ids.
- searchengine_cluster: named 400 **"Invalid License"** → dbaas_probe `searchengine-license` mode
  iterates omitted/""/null/OPEN_SOURCE/BASIC/ENTERPRISE.
- vpc_cidr: Delete impl (vpc 1.2) now reaches the API — 403 changed from "Action definition is not
  found" to **"You do not have permission to Action"** = endpoint EXISTS, key lacks the IAM action.
- vpc_private_nat_ip: serialized retest still 400 "TGW not in Connectable state" — same platform
  state-machine constraint as vpc_private_nat (Connectable = ACTIVE TGW firewall connection).

### Key domain knowledge mined from api-test-automation (USE THIS)
- `data/api_docs.json` (1372 endpoints, 2306 models) holds the full request schemas incl. required
  flags + patterns + enums — this is what cracked #83. `data/api_bodies.json` = doc-template bodies.
- **vpc_peering**: the API suite got create **202** with body {requester_vpc_id, approver_vpc_id,
  approver_vpc_account_id, name, description, tags:[]} — NO approver_vpc_name — and approval body
  `{"type":"CREATE_APPROVE"}` (400 while CREATING; retry). Provider sends `description: null` always
  (SDK NullableString constructor bug), omits tags, header `Scp-API-Version: vpc 1.1`.
  → `cmd/peering_probe/` bisects 6 variants (a-f) to isolate the 400 trigger (#61).
- subnet create has `type` enum **GENERAL|LOCAL|VPC_ENDPOINT** → vpc_vpc_endpoint fixture now creates
  its own VPC_ENDPOINT-type subnet 192.168.0.64/27 in the pool VPC (flip → untested).
- certificate_manager's "platform 500" happened sending placeholder PEM; API suite proves cert creation
  works → fixture now generates real self-signed PEM via hashicorp/tls (flip → untested).
- dns_public_domain_name: deliberately NOT retried — a successful create registers a REAL paid domain
  with NO delete API.

### In-flight / next
- Push of this commit triggers: coverage sweep (certificate_manager novpc + vpc_vpc_endpoint pool),
  peering-probe (2 VPCs, leak-0), dbaas-probe (`sqlserver-versions searchengine-license`; flip the
  workflow run arg back to `cleanup` after). Read those run logs, apply verdicts to the registry.
- Remaining broken after this wave = permission (vpc_cidr destroy, iam×2, loggingaudit,
  filestorage_replication), platform (TGW family ×4 + private_nat ×2, lb_listener 500-104,
  dns/budget/backup 500, peering ×3 pending probe), DBaaS ×2 pending probe.

## 0Z. Session 2026-06-09/10 — provider-fix verification, green 41→56

**Branch:** `claude/youthful-cray-608zi` (BOTH repos). **Resume:** read this section first.
**Result:** registry green **41 → 56 (+15)**. All work committed+pushed on the branch in both
repos; **pending consolidation to `main` via PR** (same pattern as PR #14).

### Provider fixes (fork `kyle-agent/terraform-provider-samsungcloudplatformv2`, branch above)
Built+verified end-to-end via source-build (`SCP_PROVIDER_SOURCE_BUILD=1`,
`SCP_PROVIDER_BUILD_REF=claude/youthful-cray-608zi`; vendored SDK under `third_party/` + go.mod
`replace` → tokenless `go build`). Issues with a verified-green test carry the GitHub label
**`fix-verified-green`** (filter: `label:fix-verified-green`):
- **#75** iam_role (CreateRole policy_ids `[]` not null) → iam_role, iam_role_policy_bindings GREEN
- **#77** loadbalancer Create wait-ACTIVE / Delete wait-gone → loadbalancer_basic, lb_server_group, public_nat_ip GREEN
- **#67/#85** virtualserver_server needs state=ACTIVE / lb_member object_id → lb_member GREEN
- **#58** iam_access_key Delete disables an enabled key first → iam_access_key GREEN (after quota freed)
- **#59** vpc_subnet dns_nameservers `[]string`→`types.List` → vpc_subnet GREEN
- **#76** TGW status-waiter no longer hangs → vpc_transit_gateway, vpc_transit_gateway_vpc_connection GREEN
- vpc_publicip Read → v1.2 ShowPublicip (SUBNET enum) → vpc_subnet_vip_nat_ip GREEN
- lb_member/lb_server_group destroy-ordering (EDITING stabilize + retry) → lb_member clean destroy
- **#60** vpc_cidr Read implemented (idempotent) — but Delete has NO server API (403 "Action definition is not found"); destroy still fails. Commented on #60.
- **#61** vpc_vpc_peering: provider now serializes `approver_vpc_name` correctly (proven: local json.Marshal emits it; remote SDK patched) BUT API still 400 "no value given … Invalid error data" → **API-side**, not provider. Commented on #61. peering ×3 stay broken.

### Non-provider GREENs this session
- virtualserver_volume (#69 tag was STALE — fixture size already ÷8; just needed a re-test)
- **virtualserver_image (#86)** — OBS image URL must be the **account-namespaced path form**:
  `https://object-store.kr-west1.e.samsungsdscloud.com/{account_id}:terraform-vmimage-test/<key>.qcow2`
  (plain bucket path → OBS `NotFoundBucketNameInPath`; virtual-hosted → no public DNS). Staging step
  now builds `${TF_VAR_obs_endpoint}/${SCP_ACCOUNT_ID}:terraform-vmimage-test/<key>`. Commented on #86.

### KEY platform constraints / gotchas discovered (save for future sessions)
- **TGW account max = 3.** "Failed to create a Transit Gateway due to exceed the maximum size(3)."
  Running >3 TGW-creating scenarios concurrently fails. TGW sub-resources (firewall, firewall_connection,
  uplink_rule) additionally require an **ACTIVE TGW firewall connection** first (multi-step state machine);
  private_nat needs the TGW in **Connectable** state (a created vpc_connection alone is NOT enough).
  These TGW-family scenarios remain broken — fixtures are valid (terraform validate ok) but the
  platform state-machine + 3-TGW cap make them hard; not a provider bug.
- **OBS path addressing = `{account_id}:{bucket}`** (account-namespaced). Buckets `terraform-vmimage-test`
  (image) + `regr-obs-*` (sweepable). Reaper now also reaps orphaned **IAM access keys** (test desc
  `regr-access-key` only; NEVER the live `SCP_ACCESS_KEY` — see `reap_access_keys` in sweep_all.py).
- **iam_access_key** caps at 2 keys/principal; an orphaned enabled key (pre-#58 bug) blocked it until the
  reaper reclaimed it. `_client.py` gained a `put` method for the disable-before-delete.
- **vpc_vpc_peering / vpc_transit_gateway_rule** fail with the same "no value for required property
  (approver_vpc_name / created_at) … Invalid error data" pattern = **API-side**, provider sends it.

### Remaining broken = platform/account/API (NOT provider-fixable)
Platform 500/ISE: backup(#80), budget/certificate/dns_public_domain(#82), loadbalancer_lb_listener
(500 code 104 — re-testing), vpc_vpc_endpoint, DBaaS eventstreams/searchengine/sqlserver(#83).
Account-perm: iam_group_member, iam_user_policy_bindings, loggingaudit_trail, filestorage_replication.
API-side: peering×3(#61/#84), tgw_rule(created_at). Platform-dep: vpc_cidr Delete, TGW firewall family,
private_nat×2, virtualserver_image needs operator OBS (now resolved).

### Dashboard note (IMPORTANT for "reflect on dashboard")
`docs/index.html` is rendered by `scripts/build_coverage_html.py` from **`coverage/coverage.json`**
(per-stage results), NOT from `coverage/registry.yaml`. `coverage.json` is updated by
`scripts/build_coverage.py <capability-matrix.json>` (merges a RUN's matrix) and is currently STALE
(Jun 8). To make the dashboard show this session's greens: re-run the fixed scenarios, then
`build_coverage.py` the resulting matrices into `coverage.json`, commit → `pages.yml` publishes.

---


**Done this session:**
- **Account cleanup** (user: "stop all tests + delete all resources"). No cron exists;
  nothing auto-runs. Extended the API reaper (`cmd/api_reaper/sweep_all.py`) and ran it
  repeatedly until the account is clean from our key's reach:
  - ServiceWatch log groups: added paginated bulk-delete; cleared all our-key-owned ones.
  - DBaaS cluster `400 InvalidServiceState` (mid-create/terminate): fixed via
    retry-with-backoff → clusters delete and release their pinned subnets/VPCs.
  - Block storage volumes: found at `virtualserver` host **`/v1/volumes`** (not
    `/v1/block-storages`); deleted 13. Also added eventstreams/vertica/gpu clusters,
    server-groups, custom images (test-prefix-guarded), backup, gslb sweeps.
  - **Final state:** core infra (VPC/subnet/server/SG) empty. Remaining = **403
    permission-boundary only**: 2 SCF log groups + backup/gslb/baremetal/gpu services
    our key has no rights on + ~5 stale lb-health-checks (400). These need the account
    owner/console or an IAM grant — the reaper can do no more with the current key.
- **Persistent multi-agent + domain-knowledge architecture** authored (so any session
  continues identically): `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agents/*`, runnable subagents in
  **`.claude/agents/*`**, `coverage/domain.yaml` + `docs/domain/*`,
  `docs/PROVIDER_VERIFICATION.md`, `docs/PROVIDER_ISSUES.md`.

**Branch consolidation (2026-06-08):** this session's work was merged to **`main`**
(PR #14) and every `claude/*` scratch branch in this repo was deleted — `main` is now
the single source of truth; new sessions branch from it. (The session token couldn't
delete branches itself — `403`; deletion was done manually.)

**Resume next session by:** reading `AGENTS.md` → this §0 → `docs/roadmap.md`. The
coverage-expansion TODO is unchanged (see §5 below): firewall_firewall_rule self-contain,
iam_role_policy_bindings, vpc_vpc_endpoint, the LB ×7 decision, virtualserver_image via
OBS. Pre-existing leaker decisions already recorded in §4/§6.

---

## 0a. Session 2026-06-08 (coverage continuation, branch `claude/youthful-cray-608zi`)

Worked the §5 TODO via 5 parallel agents (fixtures only; registry flips batched
centrally to respect the **VPC quota = 5**). All fixtures pass `terraform validate`
against provider mirror v3.3.1.

**Fixtures authored (committed, no account impact):**
- `firewall_firewall_rule` → **self-contained**: creates own VPC+subnet+IGW
  (`firewall_enabled=true`) and wires `firewall_id` from the IGW's computed
  **nested** attr `internet_gateway.firewall_id`. Lane pool→**self**.
- `iam_role_policy_bindings` → self-contained (own iam_role + iam_policy).
- `vpc_vpc_endpoint` → schema-correct OBS endpoint (resource_type=OBS,
  endpoint_ip_address `192.168.0.12` inside pool /27).
- `loadbalancer_*` (7) → all schema-valid + dependency-wired + #77 note. Ready to
  un-exclude once an always-reap is in place (see `docs/findings/loadbalancer-reap-strategy.md`).
- `virtualserver_image` → parameterized + `scripts/upload_image_to_obs.py` +
  `docs/findings/virtualserver-image-obs.md`. **Stays blocked** pending a real
  image upload test in CI.

**Batch-1 coverage sweep — run `27120875200` (VPC-safe: ≤1 concurrent VPC):**
- `firewall_firewall_rule` → ✅ **GREEN** (validate→apply→replan→destroy→destroy_verify
  all ✅, 238s; self-containment confirmed working, no leak).
- `iam_role_policy_bindings` → ❌ **broken**: apply fails at `iam_role` create with
  `400 'Input should be a valid list'` — this is **#75** (iam_role create is itself
  broken; `iam_role` scenario is also #75-broken). Blocked-by-dependency, not a
  fixture defect. The concrete 400 message is a fresh diagnostic for #75.
- `vpc_vpc_endpoint` → ⊘ **not exercised**: pool bootstrap `terraform init` hit a
  **transient `504 Gateway Timeout`** fetching provider v3.3.2 from GitHub (mirror
  download 504 → direct-registry fallback also 504). NOT a fixture/quota/leak issue
  (init failed before any resource → **no VPC leaked**). Left `untested` and
  re-pushed to retry (only vpc_vpc_endpoint re-runs).

**vpc_vpc_endpoint retry (run 27121247070):** apply ❌ `400 'VPC Endpoint Type Subnet
not found'` even with a REAL pool subnet_id → **platform/AZ limitation**, not a fixture
defect. Marked **broken** (blocked-with-findings). Teardown clean, no leak.

**Batch 2 = loadbalancer family (run 27121594571, 6 pool LB scenarios, 1 shard):**
- `loadbalancer_lb_health_check` → ✅ **GREEN** (full lifecycle).
- 5 failed on FIXTURE issues (now fixed by an agent, commit WIP 3d1db26):
  (a) **LB name collision** — all scenarios in a shard share one `TF_VAR_name_suffix`,
  so `rlb${suffix}` collided across scenarios (`...name(rlb4d39a5) already exists`).
  Fix: scenario-distinct short stems (`rlbb/rlbl/rlbp/rlbg/rlbm`). (b) `lb_server_group`
  & `lb_member` need an **LB already in the subnet** — fix: each now creates its own LB
  first (+depends_on). (c) `lb_member` plan failure was a cascade of (b), object_id
  wiring was already correct.
- **`loadbalancer_basic` → broken (#77, provider Create-no-wait):** apply/replan OK but
  destroy `400 not in a deletable state (CREATING)` — provider `Loadbalancer.Create`
  returns before ACTIVE and has no wait knob, so quick create→destroy leaks the LB →
  pinned the pool subnet → **subnet/VPC 409 leak**. Reaper run **27121999759** reclaimed
  the leaked subnet `8a65f4…`+VPC `b3c1ae…` (`sweep_all done: 5 deleted`) → account clean.
- **Re-test (run 27122245554) — fixtures fixed but 3 provider/platform blockers remain;
  see `docs/findings/loadbalancer-family.md`:**
  - `lb_server_group` → apply ✅ replan ✅ **destroy ❌** (#77 CREATING leak).
  - `lb_listener`, `loadbalancer_public_nat_ip` → **apply ❌ 409** "only Load Balancer
    under the subnet is not in ACTIVE state" = **ONE-LB-per-subnet** limit; the shared
    pool subnet at `parallel: 4` makes LB scenarios collide.
  - `lb_member` → **plan ❌** provider rejects a COMPUTED `object_id` (backend server.id,
    unknown-at-plan) when `object_type=VM` (plan-validation bug).
  - All 4 marked **broken** with precise per-scenario `issues`. The `lb_server_group` LB
    leaked → reaper re-fired (run after commit 06fb1cc) to reclaim subnet/VPC.

**Provider #77 + 2 sibling blockers gate the LB family** (documented in
`docs/findings/loadbalancer-family.md`): (1) Create doesn't wait for ACTIVE → CREATING
destroy leak; (2) one-LB-per-subnet vs shared-pool-parallel; (3) lb_member computed
object_id rejected at plan. Net LB result: **lb_health_check green; the other 6 broken/
excluded** with provider-actionable diagnostics. To make them green later: re-model LB
scenarios as `vpc: self` (own subnet) + serial, AND land the #77 Create-wait fix.

**`virtualserver_image` — probed & characterized (broken/blocked):** wired the novpc lane
to upload a tiny real **CirrOS** qcow2 to OBS and pass its URL. The probe nailed the
platform image-import contract in 3 iterations — **URL must end `.qcow2`** (fixed via OBS
`--key`), **os_distro in allow-list** (`cirros`→**`ubuntu`** fixed), and **a fetchable OBS
URL**. Final blocker: the OBS test key **cannot create buckets**
(`ForbidCreateBucketException`, run 27124795518), so staging fails and the dummy URL is
used. This is a permission boundary (cf. §8). Resume: supply a pre-existing writable OBS
bucket via `--bucket`/`OBS_BUCKET` (helper now reuses an existing bucket) — see
`docs/findings/virtualserver-image-obs.md` "Probe results".

## 1. What this project does

`terraform-test-automation` exercises every resource in the
`samsungcloudplatformv2` Terraform provider against a **dedicated single-tenant
SCP test account** (account `9b13e0d04b7544ad8b66905cd94888bd`, region
`kr-west1`, env `e`) and records a per-stage capability matrix
(validate / plan / apply / replan / update / import / destroy / destroy_verify).

- **Source of truth:** `coverage/registry.yaml` — one entry per scenario with
  `status` (green / broken / untested / excluded), `vpc` lane (none / pool / self),
  `needs`, `depends_on`, `issues`, `cost`, etc. Validated by
  `scripts/validate_registry.py`. (Originally seeded by `scripts/gen_registry.py`;
  now hand-edited. Re-dump style: `yaml.safe_dump(sort_keys=True,
  default_flow_style=False, width=100)` — keep diffs minimal.)
- **Scenarios:** `scenarios/<name>/main.tf` — each a self-contained fixture with
  offline-safe defaults so `terraform validate` passes without creds.
- **Matrix runner:** `tests/capability` (Go), driven by env
  `MATRIX_SCENARIOS`, `DESTROY_VERIFY=1`, `CAPABILITY_MATRIX=1`.

### Lanes (set by `scripts/plan_matrix.py`)
- `none` (novpc): no VPC needed; run in parallel.
- `pool`: share one bootstrapped VPC + prereqs (subnet, SG, public IP, keypair,
  IGW+firewall, filestorage, image lookup). Bootstrapped in `bootstrap/`, torn
  down `if: always()` at job end. TF_VARs (vpc_id, subnet_id, security_group_id,
  publicip_id, ip_address, keypair_name, image_id, server_type_id, volume_id,
  kubernetes_version, …) are injected from bootstrap outputs.
- `self` (selfvpc): scenario creates its own VPC; runs **after** pool, low parallel.

### How to run a sweep
- **Push trigger** (re-added this session): pushing to `claude/**` touching
  `.github/workflows/coverage-sweep-pool.yml`, `coverage/registry.yaml`, or
  `scripts/plan_matrix.py` runs `coverage-sweep-pool.yml` with
  `SELECT_STATUS='untested'` (discovery of newly-flipped scenarios).
- **Manual:** `workflow_dispatch` on *Coverage Sweep Pool* (inputs:
  `select_status`, `select_vpc`, `select_family`). NOTE: API `workflow_dispatch`
  is **403 for the integration token** — use the Actions UI, or the push trigger.
- **No cron** anywhere (deliberate — nothing runs automatically on the paid
  dedicated account).

### Leak cleanup — the API reaper
- `cmd/api_reaper/sweep_all.py` deletes test-created resources **by id via the
  Open API** (HMAC), in dependency order (children→parents), covering
  loadbalancers, subnets, VPCs, TGWs, etc. Needed because the provider implements
  no ImportState for many resources (issue #81), so terraform alone can't always
  clean leaks.
- Trigger: **push to `claude/**` touching `cmd/api_reaper/{sweep_all,reap,_client}.py`
  or `.github/workflows/api-reaper.yml`** (this path is NOT in coverage-sweep's
  paths, so a reaper-only commit won't re-trigger a coverage run). On push/manual:
  `SWEEP_MIN_AGE_HOURS=0`, `SWEEP_ALL=1` (deletes everything on the account, guarded
  by `EXPECTED_ACCOUNT_ID`). Also sweeps leaked OBS buckets via `scripts/obs_bucket.py`.
- **VPC quota is 5.** Leaked VPCs are the main recurring hazard — always confirm
  pool teardown succeeded, and reap if a subnet/VPC delete 409s.

---

## 2. This session's goal & track selection

User chose 3 tracks to pursue (DBaaS #83 explicitly de-scoped — needs the user's
own console payloads):

1. **Tier-1 free re-runs + fixture fixes** — retest scenarios that were only
   "broken" due to prior account leaks/quota, and fix self-containable fixtures.
2. **Load balancer ×7 reconsideration** — un-exclude the 7 `loadbalancer_*`
   scenarios now that the reaper tears down LB children (was excluded for #77
   destroy-leak).
3. **`virtualserver_image` via OBS** — upload a real image file to OBS and point
   the fixture's `image_url` at it.

---

## 3. Work done this session

### Registry flips (commit 137282e)
- `vpn_vpn_gateway`, `vpn_vpn_tunnel`: broken → **untested** (retest; the "broken"
  was quota-masking from peering leaks, not a real failure).
- `servicewatch_log_stream`: broken → **untested** (already self-contained — it
  creates its own parent log group).
- `loadbalancer_basic`: excluded → **untested** (premise test for track 2).
- Cleared stale `issues` on those four.

### Workflow trigger restored (commit 137282e)
- Re-added the `push` trigger to `coverage-sweep-pool.yml` (claude/**, scoped to
  the 3 paths above) so coverage runs are drivable from a push.

### Reaper triggered (commit 38921bf)
- Touched `api-reaper.yml` to fire a sweep and reclaim a leaked pool VPC (see §4).

### Reaper gap fixed — ServiceWatch log groups (commit 845ca07)
- The reaper covered **no** ServiceWatch resources, so log groups (and nested log
  streams) accumulated every run. Added `reap_servicewatch()` to `sweep_all.py`:
  self-discovers the collection path (`/v1/log-groups` on host
  `servicewatch.kr-west1.e.samsungsdscloud.com`), **bulk-deletes** via
  `DELETE /v1/log-groups {"ids":[...]}`, with id-field + per-id/stream-clear
  fallbacks. Now part of every sweep.
- Confirmed by reaper run `27115120403`: found **20** log groups
  (ske/mysql/mariadb/scf `slowlog`·`alertlog` auto-created groups) and deleted all
  in one bulk call (`DELETE … -> 200`, `sweep_all done: 32 deleted`).
- NOTE: many of these are **auto-created by other services** (DBaaS/SKE/SCF), not
  just the servicewatch fixtures — they reappear whenever those resources run, so
  the recurring reaper sweep (not a one-off) is what keeps them clear.

---

## 4. Batch-1 run results — run `27095226766` (commit 137282e)

All 4 jobs green at orchestration level. Per-scenario verdicts:

| scenario | lane | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `vpn_vpn_gateway` | self | ✅ **GREEN** — validate→apply→replan→destroy→destroy_verify all ✅ |
| `vpn_vpn_tunnel` | self | ✅ **GREEN** — all stages ✅ |
| `servicewatch_log_stream` | none | ✅ green (log_group + log_stream apply/replan/destroy ✅) |
| `loadbalancer_basic` | pool | ❌ applied, but **leaked the LB on destroy (#77)** → pool subnet/VPC teardown 409'd (CONFIRMED leaker) |
| `vpc_private_nat_ip` | pool | ✅ not the leaker (reaper found no leaked private-nat); treat as passing — re-confirm its matrix |

**The pool bootstrap teardown failed:**
```
Error: Error Deleting subnet
Could not delete subnet, unexpected error: 409 Conflict
Reason: Cannot terminate due to associated resources.
```
The bootstrap destroyed 6/7 prereqs; the **subnet delete 409'd because a scenario
left a resource attached**, so the **VPC delete never ran → pool VPC leaked**
(quota hazard). Teardown uses `|| true`, so the job still reported success — do
not trust job-level "success"; always check the teardown step + matrix.

> **RESOLVED:** API Reaper run `27106727666` (commit 38921bf) finished `success`
> and its sweep log shows it deleted **2 loadbalancers** + the pool subnet
> `d2b58daf…` + the pool VPC `f32a21d9…` → **`loadbalancer_basic` is the leaker
> (#77 confirmed); the leaked pool VPC was reclaimed.** No leaked private-nat was
> found, so `vpc_private_nat_ip` did not leak.
>
> ⚠️ **Residual leftover for next session:** a few older VPCs still 409 on delete,
> each pinned by an ACTIVE `regrsub*` subnet that itself won't delete (run
> `27115120403` showed VPCs `1ffe9883…`/`c54babfe…` blocked by subnets
> `regrsub6a263eb9`/`regrsub6a260c25`; an earlier pass showed `257aca2c…` blocked
> by a subnet + an unnamed port `acbb5f5e…`). The reaper retries the subnet 6×
> then the VPC 6× and still 409s, so something the per-type sweep doesn't
> enumerate is pinning these subnets (ports? a VIP/static-nat? check the subnet's
> SHOW body). These are slowly accumulating — investigate what pins a stuck
> `regrsub*` subnet and extend the reaper, or delete by id via the scp-api skill.

### Conclusions
- **vpn gateway/tunnel were never really broken** — clean-account retest passes.
  → set both to **green**.
- **servicewatch_log_stream** passes self-contained → set **green**.
- **loadbalancer_basic** confirms #77: it applies/replans fine but **leaks on
  destroy**, blocking pool subnet/VPC teardown. The reaper *can* reclaim it, but
  the reaper runs out-of-band, so every LB run leaves a transient VPC leak until
  swept. **Decision needed** (see §5, track 2).

---

## 5. Remaining TODO (with concrete plans)

### Track 1 — fixture fixes still open
- **`firewall_firewall_rule`** (broken: "404 needs firewall target"). Plan:
  make **self-contained** — add `vpc_vpc` + `vpc_internet_gateway` (IGW
  auto-creates a firewall) and wire `firewall_id =
  samsungcloudplatformv2_vpc_internet_gateway.regr.firewall_id` (confirmed: the
  IGW resource exposes a computed `firewall_id`; e.g. bootstrap IGW showed
  `firewall_id = 2df9b387ca2445e8991caa52ad2c0970`). This converts it to a
  `vpc: self` scenario. IGW required args seen in bootstrap: `vpc_id`, `type="IGW"`,
  `firewall_enabled`, `firewall_loggable`.
- **`iam_role_policy_bindings`** (broken: "404 needs own role"). Plan: self-contain
  by creating an `iam_role` + `iam_policy` and binding them. **Risk:** `iam_role`
  itself is broken (#75) — if role *create* is broken this stays blocked. Verify
  `iam_role` apply independently first; if create works, self-contain.
- **`vpc_vpc_endpoint`** (broken: 400 "VPC Endpoint Type Subnet not found"). Needs
  config investigation — likely the `endpoint_ip_address` must sit inside the pool
  subnet CIDR (`192.168.0.0/27`, usable .1–.30; default fixture uses .30) and/or
  `resource_type`/`resource_key`/`resource_info` for OBS need correct values.
  Could be a provider/platform limitation — timebox it.

### Track 2 — load balancers (7 scenarios)
LB set: `loadbalancer_basic` (untested), and **excluded**:
`loadbalancer_lb_health_check`, `loadbalancer_lb_listener`, `loadbalancer_lb_member`,
`loadbalancer_lb_server_group`, `loadbalancer_loadbalancer_private_nat_ip`,
`loadbalancer_loadbalancer_public_nat_ip`.
- Premise confirmed: LB **applies/replans fine but destroy-leaks (#77)**, leaving
  the pool VPC unreclaimable by terraform → reaper must sweep.
- **Open decision:** is a transient per-run VPC leak (reclaimed only by an
  out-of-band reaper) acceptable to gain apply/replan coverage? Options:
  (a) keep LB scenarios **excluded** (status quo, no leak); (b) mark
  **broken #77** and run only in dedicated sweeps that always reap after; (c) add
  an **always-reap step** to the LB lane so the leak is cleaned in-run.
  **Recommend (c)** if pursuing LB coverage; otherwise leave excluded.
- The 6 sub-resource LB scenarios (listener/member/server_group/health_check/
  nat_ips) also need their inter-dependencies wired (listener/member need a
  server_group + LB id) before they can run.

### Track 3 — `virtualserver_image` via OBS
- Currently broken: "invalid OBS image URL (needs real image file)". Fixture
  (`scenarios/virtualserver_image/main.tf`) registers an image from
  `var.image_url` (disk_format=qcow2, container_format=bare, os_distro=ubuntu).
- Plan: upload a **real, valid** disk image to OBS (use `scripts/obs_bucket.py`
  patterns + boto3; OBS endpoint `https://object-store.kr-west1.e.samsungsdscloud.com`),
  make it readable, and pass its URL via `TF_VAR_image_url`. **Caveat:** a real
  Ubuntu cloud image is ~600 MB (heavy upload + platform import time/cost). A tiny
  valid qcow2 may be rejected by the platform's import validation — verify. Timebox;
  if the platform rejects small images, mark blocked with findings.

## 6. Registry state — DONE this session (now safe)

Already applied (commit with this doc). **`untested` count is now 0**, so a push
of `registry.yaml` triggers an *empty* coverage matrix (no bootstrap, no leak):
- `vpn_vpn_gateway` → **green** ✅
- `vpn_vpn_tunnel` → **green** ✅
- `servicewatch_log_stream` → **green** ✅
- `loadbalancer_basic` → **broken** (`#77` destroy-leak)
- `vpc_private_nat_ip` → **broken** (pending leaker confirmation — see §4; if the
  reaper log shows it did NOT leak and it passed cleanly, flip back to **green**)

**Pushing is safe.** When you flip a scenario to `untested` to test it, expect a
coverage run; always confirm pool teardown + reap after.

## 7. Key facts / gotchas
- Account `9b13e0d04b7544ad8b66905cd94888bd`, region `kr-west1`, env `e`.
- **VPC quota = 5**; leaked VPCs are the main hazard.
- Pool bootstrap: VPC `192.168.0.0/24`, subnet `192.168.0.0/27`, IGW w/ firewall.
- `server_type_id=s1v1m2`; image lookup picks newest Ubuntu (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04).
- Provider mirror pinned to `v3.3.2` in the workflows.
- IGW resource exposes computed `firewall_id` (useful for firewall_firewall_rule).
- Job-level "success" is unreliable (teardown is `|| true`); read the matrix +
  teardown step.
- Issue tags referenced: #58 (iam_access_key), #59/#60 (vpc_subnet/cidr), #69
  (virtualserver_volume), #75 (iam_role), #76 (vpc_private_nat/TGW), #77 (LB
  destroy-leak), #81 (no ImportState → reaper), #82 (dns 500), #83 (DBaaS family).

## 8. Account cleanup state & reaper findings (2026-06-08)

Triggered by leftovers piling up (ServiceWatch log groups, stuck subnets/VPCs).
Reaper (`cmd/api_reaper/sweep_all.py`) was extended; key findings:

- **No cron anywhere; nothing auto-runs.** All workflows (coverage-sweep-pool,
  dbaas-probe, obs-probe, inventory) are push(`claude/**`, path-scoped) or
  workflow_dispatch only. "Stop all tests" = already true when nothing is
  in-progress/queued. The producers of the leaked DBaaS resources are
  `dbaas-probe` (this repo, `cmd/dbaas_probe/probe.py`, creates+deletes clusters)
  and/or the external `api-test-automation` regression (out of our repo scope).
- **ServiceWatch reaper added + paginated** (commits 845ca07, 1f29952). Drains
  every log group OUR key owns. BUT: the list endpoint is **principal-scoped** —
  it returns only `count: N` groups created by our access key (`2a579fc…`). The
  ~400 groups seen in the **console are owned by managed-service principals**
  (e.g. SCF `bc371a79…`, DBaaS `1f0465d2…`): our key gets **403** on delete and
  can't even list them. **This is an IAM permission boundary, not a reaper bug.**
  To clear those: delete from the console as the account owner, OR grant the
  reaper's IAM key ServiceWatch delete perms, OR delete the owning parent
  resource (SCF function / DB cluster) so the service removes its own log groups.
- **DBaaS cluster delete `400` diagnosed** (commit c12e1e7): body =
  `Dbaas.ValidationError.InvalidServiceState` ("Invalid service state") — the
  cluster was mid-create/terminate. Fix: retry delete with backoff (now in the
  reaper); confirmed clusters then go 400→404 / →202 and release their pinned
  subnet/VPC (those were the stuck `regrsub* "API regression"` subnets). So the
  stuck-subnet mystery = a still-settling DBaaS cluster pinning the subnet.
- **Still unreapable by our key (need console/owner action):** 2 SCF log groups
  (`/scp/scf/regrscf6a25917a`, `…6a242ac1`, 403); ~5 stale `lb-health-checks`
  that 400; and the bulk of the console's ~400 log groups (foreign principals).
- **"failed resource" deletion:** the reaper deletes by id regardless of status,
  but the platform rejects deletes of resources in a bad/transitional state
  (DBaaS 400 InvalidServiceState, subnet/VPC 409). It now retries transient
  states; genuinely foreign-owned ones (403) can't be deleted with our key.

### Reaper coverage expanded (commit 695afbc) + final cleanup state
Per user request ("delete block storage + all other resources"). Added sweeps:
- **block storage volumes** — found at **`virtualserver` host, `/v1/volumes`**
  (NOT `/v1/block-storages`, which 403s). Last run deleted **13** leaked volumes
  (202). baremetal-blockstorage/`/v1/block-storages` 403 (no perm/none).
- eventstreams / vertica / multinodegpucluster clusters (same /v1/clusters +
  retry). `multinodegpucluster` 403 (not enabled for our key).
- virtualserver server-groups + custom images (images guarded to test-prefix
  names so base/public OS images are never deleted).
- backup (`/v1/vaults`,`/v1/backup-policies`) and gslb (`/v1/gslbs`,`/v1/gslb`):
  all **403** for our key.
- **Final state:** the account-id probe returned `unknown/empty` (no
  VPC/subnet/server/SG left) — core infra is CLEANED. Everything our reaper key
  can reach is deleted. **Remaining = 403 permission-boundary only:** 2 SCF log
  groups (`/scp/scf/regrscf*`, owned by SCF principal `bc371a79…`), plus the
  backup/gslb/baremetal/gpu services our key has no rights on, and ~5 stale
  `lb-health-checks` that 400. These need the **account owner / console**, or an
  IAM grant giving the reaper key (`2a579fc…`) delete rights on ServiceWatch/SCF/
  backup/gslb. The reaper itself can do no more with the current key.

## 0c. Session 2026-06-09 — provider #77 fixed, built, and proven (LB greens)

Pivoted to **fixing the provider** (the dominant coverage blocker). Key arc:

- **SDK build blocker solved.** The public provider depends on the PRIVATE
  `terraform-sdk-samsungcloudplatformv2` module (404 without org access; the fork has no
  GH_ACCESS_TOKEN). The operator supplied the SDK; it is **MIT-licensed**, so it was
  **vendored in-repo** at `third_party/terraform-sdk-samsungcloudplatformv2/` (trimmed to
  *.go+go.mod, ~61MB) with a `go.mod replace`. Now `go build ./...` works with **no token**
  (fixes provider #50). Provider `build-check` CI is green.
- **#77 fix implemented** in `service/loadbalancer/loadbalancer.go` (provider repo,
  branch `claude/youthful-cray-608zi`): `Create` waits for ACTIVE (new
  `waitForLoadbalancerStatus`, mirrors vpngateway) then re-Reads; `Delete` waits until the
  LB is gone before returning (so dependent subnet delete doesn't 409). Compiles locally + CI.
- **Harness runs the PATCHED provider.** `scripts/setup_provider_mirror.sh` gained a
  `SCP_PROVIDER_SOURCE_BUILD=1` mode: it clones the fork (`SCP_PROVIDER_BUILD_REF`) and
  `go build`s the provider into the filesystem mirror instead of downloading the release.
  Enabled via env in `coverage-sweep-pool.yml`. (Keep ON to retain the LB greens; the
  released provider lacks #77.)
- **Result (run 27212070186, patched provider):**
  - `loadbalancer_basic` -> **GREEN** (full lifecycle, clean destroy, no leak).
  - `loadbalancer_lb_server_group` -> **GREEN** (full lifecycle).
  - `loadbalancer_loadbalancer_public_nat_ip` -> apply/replan OK (IGW fixture fix worked);
    **destroy 409** — publicip "not deletable (ATTACHED)" + LB "associated resources":
    a destroy-ordering gap (public NAT / publicip detach not awaited). Next provider fix.
  - `loadbalancer_lb_listener` -> **apply 500 ISE** "Failed to create listener (code 104)"
    (after session_duration_time + routing_action fixture fixes) — platform-side; timebox.
  - Fixture fixes committed: lb_listener `routing_action=LB_SERVER_GROUP` + `session_duration_time=120`;
    public_nat_ip adds an IGW (+depends_on).

**Pipeline proven end-to-end:** provider source fix -> vendored tokenless build -> source-built
mirror -> coverage sweep -> green. The remaining 22 provider-blocked scenarios (#76 TGW ×7,
#75 iam ×2, #59/#60/#67/#69/#74/#82/#85 …) can be unblocked the same way: patch the provider
on this branch, the source-built mirror picks it up, re-test.

**Resume:** confirm reaper run after 27212070186 reclaimed the lb_listener/public_nat leaks;
then either (a) fix the next provider bug (e.g. public_nat destroy-ordering, or #76 TGW), or
(b) retry lb_listener (transient 500?). Source-build stays enabled in coverage-sweep-pool.yml.
